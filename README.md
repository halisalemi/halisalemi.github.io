# About me 
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). Prior to this, I earned my PhD in the [School of Industrial Engineering and Management](https://iem.okstate.edu/) at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/) under supervision of [Dr. Austin Buchanan](https://austinlbuchanan.github.io/). I also hold an MSc in Management Engineering from [Polytechnic University of Milan](https://www.polimi.it/en/) under supervision of [Dr. Riccardo Mangiaracina](https://www.som.polimi.it/en/professor/mangiaracina-riccardo/) and a BSc in Industrial and Systems Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/en/).

My **email** is hsalemi(at)iastate(dot)edu. You can find my **CV** [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_IMphh3CjNon-iR4ReLyaj3pdNPaesU/view?usp=sharing) and my **Google Scholar** [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rvuBQ_MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

# Research
My research focuses on theory and computation in network design and analysis, applications of combinatorial optimization in data analytics of complex networks, and applications of OR/MS in supply chain management, transportation, and the energy sector.
